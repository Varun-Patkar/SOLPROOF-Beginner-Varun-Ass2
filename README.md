# Project for Module 2 - SOLPROOF Beginner Varun Ass2

Here we create a new account, airdrop SOL into it, connect phantom wallet and transfer SOL to it from newly created wallet.

## Problem Statement

Your final challenge for this module is to build based on what you have learned. You can again work locally or with GitPod.

Here are the instructions for the final challenge:

1. Create a front end with a small button titled “Create a new Solana account” that generates a new KeyPair at the backend and airdrops 2 SOL to the newly created Keypair.
2. Once this step is completed, create another button that says - “Connect to Phantom Wallet”, which should connect to the Phantom Wallet if it exists, else point to a link where the user can install the extension.
3. Once this step is completed, add a button called “Transfer to new wallet”. This button should trigger a transfer of 2 SOL (airdropped into the account you generated in step 1) to the account connected in Step 2.

You can have all the 3 buttons on the same page or on different pages - that’s completely up to you. It is not mandatory to have a great design but rather functionality is the prime focus area.

There are four requirements for the assessment:

1. You will submit your project on GitHub, so you will need an account and know how to share a public repository
2. You will include a README.md file in your project's GitHub repository (root folder). The README should provide a concise and clear overview of your project's purpose and functionality. This will help other developers understand the motivation behind your project and how to use it.
3. You will record a video of 5mins or less. In the video, you will do a code walk-through where you share your screen and explain the code. Then run your code, continuing to share your screen and record yourself, and explain the resulting output. Note: we will accept just audio with a screenshare, but, we highly recommend doing the video and screenshare since it will better prepare you for job interviews.
4. For some assessments/projects, you will need to share a transaction ID. (This project is NOT one of them.)
